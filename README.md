### 1. What is one major limitation of the "Critique & Refine" loop you built, and how might you address it in a production system?

The major limitation is lack of objective quality metrics. The system relies entirely on subjective LLM evaluation without measurable standards, leading to inconsistent critiques and no guarantee that iterations actually improve content quality.

In a production system, I would address this by implementing hybrid evaluation with objective metrics: combining automated quality scores (readability, engagement potential, CTA strength, hashtag effectiveness, length optimization) with LLM critique. This approach would use measurable thresholds (e.g., overall score ‚â• 7.0/10) to make consistent refinement decisions, while still leveraging LLM intelligence for nuanced feedback. The system would also track historical performance data to continuously improve quality assessment and prevent the circular reasoning problem inherent in pure LLM-to-LLM evaluation.

### 2. Why is managing the AgentState so critical in a cyclical graph like this one?

Managing the AgentState is critical in cyclical graphs because state persistence and consistency across iterations is essential for intelligent decision-making. 


Without proper state management, each cycle would be isolated, causing the agent to lose learning from previous iterations and potentially get stuck in endless refinement loops. The centralized state acts as the "memory" that enables the cyclical graph to make informed decisions about when to continue refining versus when to exit the loop.

# LangGraph Marketing Agent

A Python-based marketing agent that generates, critiques, and refines marketing posts with human-in-the-loop capabilities using LangGraph and OpenAI GPT-4o.

## Overview

This project implements an intelligent marketing content generator that uses AI to create high-quality marketing posts through an iterative self-correction process. The agent researches topics, generates content, critiques its own work, and refines the output until it meets quality standards or receives human approval.

## Workflow

```
START ‚Üí Research ‚Üí Copywriting ‚Üí Critic ‚Üí Quality Check
                      ‚Üë                        ‚Üì
                      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (refine loop) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
                      |                        ‚Üì
                      |                 Human Approval
                      |                        ‚Üì
                      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄif Rejected‚îÄ‚îÄ {Approved/Rejected}
                                               ‚Üì
                                              END
```

### Flow Steps:
1. **Research**: Gathers mock research data about the topic
2. **Copywriting**: Creates or refines marketing post using GPT-4o
3. **Critic**: Analyzes the draft against quality criteria
4. **Quality Check**: Decides whether to refine further or seek human approval
5. **Human Approval**: Final review and approval by human user

## Features

- **Self-Correction Loop**: Iterative refinement based on AI critiques
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Final human approval with feedback capability
- **Quality Assessment**: 8-point evaluation framework
- **Interactive Configuration**: Customizable max iterations (1-5)
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time iteration and quality monitoring

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   # Create .env file with:
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
    LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT=https://api.smith.langchain.com
    LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langchain_api_key_here

   ```

## Usage

Run the agent:
```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the interactive prompts to:
- Select or enter your marketing request
- Configure refinement parameters
- Review and approve the generated content

## Dependencies

- LangGraph: State graph management
- LangChain: LLM integration
- OpenAI: GPT-4o for content generation
- Python-dotenv: Environment variable management
